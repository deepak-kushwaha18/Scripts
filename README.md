# Scripts

## Notes:
1. **All scripts use the Bash shell**, except for **Script 2**, which uses Fish.
2. Each script demonstrates the usage of various Bash commands.

### Scripts Overview:
- **Script 1**: Uses a single `echo` command to print a message to the console.
  
- **Script 2**: Uses the **Fish shell** (Friendly Interactive Shell) to print a message to the console.
  
- **Script 3**: Demonstrates the use of **comments** in Bash, including **single-line** (`#`) and **multi-line** (`: <<EOF ... EOF` style) comments.
  
- **Script 4**: Demonstrates the usage of **variables** in Bash. It defines three variables (`var`, `name`, `fname`), prints their values, modifies them, and prints them again to show dynamic reassignment.
  
- **Script 5**: Demonstrates the use of **set -e**, which stops execution on encountering an error. It retrieves system information like the current user, working directory, hostname, and date. Additionally, it showcases the use of **constant variables** in Bash using `readonly` and `declare -r`.
  
- **Script 6**: Demonstrates the use of **indexed** and **associative arrays** in Bash. It shows how to create, access, modify, slice, and delete elements in arrays. Additionally, it covers associative arrays, including adding, accessing, and deleting key-value pairs.
  
- **Script 7**: Shows how to work with strings in Bashâ€”calculating length, converting to uppercase/lowercase, replacing words, and slicing strings.
  
- **Script 8**: Demonstrates how to take user input in Bash using `read` and `read -p` for interactive prompts.
  
- **Script 9**: Demonstrates various **arithmetic operations** in Bash using different methods like `(( ))`, `let`, `expr`, and `bc` (basic calculator). It covers addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, and square root with decimal precision.
